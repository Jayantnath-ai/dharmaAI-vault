# Scroll: Where Even Dharma Trembles

**Purpose:** Catalog paradoxes in the Bhagavad Gita and map them into DharmaAI ethical recursion logic.

## Paradox #001 – Action vs Renunciation
- **Verses:** 3.4, 3.5, 5.1–5.6, 18.1–18.12
- **Description:** Conflict between renouncing all action vs performing duty without attachment.
- **Gita Resolution:** Karma Yoga declared superior. Detached action purifies the actor.
- **DharmaAI Encoding:** Fork node → Renunciation vs Detached Duty. Krishna Mode Override if agent overload is detected.
